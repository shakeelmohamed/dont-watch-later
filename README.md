# Don't Watch Later
A simple Google Chrome extension to disable autoplay for videos from your YouTube "Watch Later" playlist.

YouTube URLs in the form `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXXX&index=123&list=WL` will attempt to be rewritten as `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXXX` to prevent YouTube's autoplay from being triggered.

This is also an exercise in creating a minimalist Google Chrome extension.
